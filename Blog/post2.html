              Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, helps to improve the quality
              of network traffic to the site you host on the internet through
              natural search engine results. In an article titled,
              <em
                ><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/"
                  >"HTML5 Semantic Tags: What Are They and How To Use Them!"</a
                ></em
              >, written by Jason Barnard in 2017, talks a lot about this
              subject and some of the quickest and easiest ways to improve SEO
              through correcting the HTML semantic markup tags. One thing that
              peaked my curiosity about this article wasn't that increasing
              network traffic could bring your business millions it might be
              losing out on due to poorly written code, not because SEO is a
              "HOT" trend, no. Disability. Let me Explain.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his article, Barnard discusses the importance of HTML5 and the
              proper use of semantic tags so that browsers can more efficiently
              provide information to the audience, some of whom have
              disabilitys. People who are vision impaired or blind and utilize
              screen readers depend on good code, code that is written to
              support their disability and encourage them to include themselves
              in this ever evolving realm of technology. If you are looking for
              a way to improve the ethics of your company, to bring more light
              to your company's system of values and beliefs, disability rights
              is a great place to begin and a fantastic way to ensure that not
              only are you supporting, perhaps, an underserved community within
              technology, but you are also increasing exposure of your business
              or product.

              One of the things I tried to do in styling a recent blog app was
              just that, bring a cognisance to the design, and making sure that
              the layout is simple, straight forward, and easy to navigate. I
              also tried to make button sizes slightly larger for anyone
              suffering with movement limitations or impingements, particularly
              parkinson's, making sure the button is the only thing in its area
              to be pressed, and that it is not stacked up against a bunch of
              small hyperlinked text.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of the structural layout, I tried to create a sort of
              card-feature with the images and text, where they can be easily
              manipulated and adjusted with CSS, but individually targeted if
              need be. I also tried to, with the mobile in particular, keep
              things as simple and minimalist as possible with buttons and
              animations. I liked the curved border for the pictures, giving it
              a softer feel to the contrasting color tones.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think this design is really striving to practice advocation
              through design, using different design elements, strategies,
              layouts, focused heavily on supporting the target audience. I
              think one of the most challenging things about the visual aspect
              of my design is how much I can over simplify things, versuus how I
              can just-as easily under-simplify and make the site complicated
              and crowded. While we all continue to work with one another and
              grow through time, design is something I constantly visit humbly
              when looking to see how I can best be of service.
