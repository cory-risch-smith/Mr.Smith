      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        Michelle Alexander, the author of the New York Times Bestseller book
        titled
        <a href="https://newjimcrow.com/"
          ><em
            >The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of
            Colorblindness</em
          ></a
        >, thoroughly examines the implementation of the mass incarceration
        system. She provides historical evidence of past marginalization and
        oppression of communities of color and displays how it has shifted and
        adapted to present-day life. Her book addresses minorities and
        communities of color, and while this paper will focus more specifically
        on black communities, she illuminates another deeply embedded process of
        reconstruction. In her book, Alexander shows how the United States’
        deployment of mass incarceration, through legislation and the
        enforcement of detainment and relocation, has reconstructed the
        commodification of the black body. A successful business requires
        planning and requires both investment and return on that investment. If
        colored bodies are the commodity, then who are the buyers and sellers?
      </p>

      <h3>Legislation</h3>

      <p>
        Legislation has historically acted as an extremely capable and insidious
        scapegoat that white folks have utilized in justifying and rationalizing
        business ventures, decision making, and the securing of profit. Congress
        has passed many pieces of legislation that has not only prevented black
        folks opportunity and access to resources, but that has contributed
        towards to herding of marginalized and oppressed communities, especially
        black folks, into circumstances that are profitable for whites. Of a
        broad coverage of Congressionally passed Acts and policies created by
        the U.S. government, Alexander wrote about the Drug Abuse Act, initially
        constructed in 1986, and revisited 1988 and explores the connection to
        the Housing and Urban Development Department, or (HUD). (Alexander 53,
        145). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act granted public housing authorities the
        right to evict any tenant who “allows any form of drug-related criminal
        activity to occur on or near public housing premises and eliminated many
        federal benefits including student loans for anyone convicted of a drug
        offense.” (Alexander 53). With the War on Drugs in full swing at this
        time and the implementation of Crack cocaine into black communities, it
        would not be long before communities of color would have to move.
        Interestingly enough, “HUD policies excluding people from housing
        assistance based on arrests as well as convictions guarantee highly
        discriminatory results.” (Alexander, 146). But the U.S. is no foreigner
        to exclusionary policy. Another piece of preventative legislation was a
        policy known as redlining. In an article titled
        <a
          href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"
          ><em>The Case for Reparations</em></a
        >, author Te-Nehisi Coates describes redlining as a system of rating and
        prevention that outlined black neighborhoods in red, rating them with
        the letter D, deeming them too high of a risk for mortgage insurance
        (Coates, CFR, 2014). The marginalization of black communities took the
        shape of being “herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took
        them for money and sport,” (Coates, CFR, 2014), forcing black folks into
        purchasing “contracts,” a result of the U.S. Congress’ creation of the
        Federal Housing Association or, (FHA), in 1934. Redlining was forcing
        capable black men and women, who were able to afford a home, to pay much
        more than the value of the house for these contracts that were
        uninsured, high risk, and provided no equity. With the ability to
        prevent the settlement of colored folk, the U.S. govt. would move on to
        the next step in their plan.
      </p>

        ><blockquote>
          “Redlining,” says Coates, was “excluding black people from the most
          legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage” (Coates, CFR, 2014).
        </blockquote>
      </em>

      <h3>Detainment</h3>

      <p>
        Slavery was a business, and for the businessmen (who are almost entirely
        white men), profits and a mass of wealth would be able to be guaranteed
        and secured, so long as the body performed. At the time, slavery was
        lucrative, but there were also a lot of bodies to profit from. Author
        Howard Zinn of A People’s History of the United States writes that “a
        million blacks had already been brought from Africa to South America and
        the Caribbean, to the Portuguese and Spanish colonies, to work as
        slaves” (Zinn 26). Zinn further explains that “Slavery was immensely
        profitable to some masters” (Zinn, 33). As U.S. policy changed and civil
        rights movements emerged and flourished, the few who were profiting had
        to ensure the maintenance of wealth, but how? By having a massive
        population of people who have historically demonstrated marketability
        and profitability, detainment would allow for the next part of the
        business plan to be executed. Alexander writes that “Rich and powerful
        people, including former vice president dick Cheney, have invested
        millions in private prisons” (Alexander, 230). With such a significant
        position of investment in the industry, there would have to be ways to
        secure capital gains, and the only way to get a return on investment
        would be to keep prisons filled. So how could that be done? With the
        U.S. government handcuffing black folks as they simultaneously handed
        them drugs, and with U.S. policies criminalizing the forced behaviors of
        communities of color, the system began to collect bodies and lots of
        them. Having a price on each head and with policies designed to force
        individuals out of their homes and targeted for arrest, the detainment
        strategy was effective. With black folks detained, now what?

      <h3>Relocation</h3>

      <p>
        The Great Migration, a topic recently covered in a lecture during a
        Community and regional Development class taught by
        <a
          href="https://education.ucdavis.edu/faculty-profile/lawrence-torry-winn"
          ><em>Dr. L.T. Winn</em></a
        >
        at the University of California, Davis, describes the U.S. historical
        event, which comprised of six million African Americans who would flee
        the South (Winn, Oct.3, 2019). Seeking economic and employment
        opportunities, protection from the law, and to escape from Jim Crow,
        they were envisioning a promise land of milk and honey. (Winn, Oct.3,
        2019) In trying to evade marginalization and oppression, black
        communities were merely switching seats on the same sinking ship. With a
        gaze set upon an illusory destination of freedom, colored folks were
        often encouraged to stay in school, and that education was a way to
        secure a bright future. However, upon arriving in education systems
        across the U.S., communities of color would face the same exclusion and
        redirection of their bodies, “as well as “zero tolerance” policies that
        effectively follow youth of color from schools to jails.” (Alexander,
        11). The school to prison pipeline, or school to prison Nexus, as Dr.
        Winn describes in a lecture on the subject, refers to the construction
        of schools and policies designed for “producing students who are
        prepared to go to prison. (Winn, Nov. 11, 2019). With black communities
        secured behind bars, here come the profits. Alexander describes the “the
        aggressive enforcement” of black communities and the ways in which it
        self-fullingly creates an “enormous market for convict leasing, in which
        prisoners were contracted out as laborers to the highest private bidder”
        (Alexander, 31). In facilities that stripped individuals of everything,
        not only would the government create a system that communities of color
        would depend on, but one that could not be escaped from. By being able
        to move the black community into a series of massive investment
        portfolios (private prisons), time would need to do its job, and money
        would continue to flow, which would once again turn the body into a
        profit.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        The U.S. has re-framed their business plan. It is one that continues to
        profit at the expense of the black community. In The New Jim Crow: Mass
        Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, Michelle Alexander shows how
        the United States’ deployment of mass incarceration, through legislation
        and the enforcement of detainment and relocation, has reconstructed the
        commodification of the black body. Where does the Black community turn
        to address the systematic marginalization and oppression experienced?
        Are they supposed to turn to the system that, not only is the only one
        that can help, but the very one that’s harming?
