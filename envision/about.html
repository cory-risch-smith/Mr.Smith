            Envision Design was created through the consideration of how to make
            Design more accessible and all inclusive. When thinking about the
            population of those who experience Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), or
            any degree of colorblindness. “Colour (color) blindness (colour
            vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%)
            and 1 in 200 women in the world. In Britain this means that there
            are approximately 3 million colour blind people (about 4.5% of the
            entire population), most of whom are
            male.”(https://www.colourblindawareness.org/). Inspired to find a
            way to advocate and provide resources for those seeking to create
            more inclusive design, to find resources and access materials,
            Envision Design was born. Envision Design simultaneously serves,
            both as a beacon, and as a pillar for Designers with CVD or any
            degree of colorblindness. It provides a space for Designers to care,
            to question, and to collaborate. It is an expansive space that
            encourages innovation, creation, but is rooted in selflessness and
            service.
